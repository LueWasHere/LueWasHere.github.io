                <h3>Introductions</h3>
                <p>Over the past many weeks I have been reading "Hole in My Life" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Gantos">Jack Gantos</a>. I've loved being able to read this emotional ride of a book and am happy to be able to cover the development of Jack into a writer in this book<br>
                <i>Over the course of this book we get to see Jack develop into a writer and realize his love for it. Here is the summary of the story found on the back of the book:<br>In the summer 1971, Jack Gantos was an aspiring young writer looking for adventure, cash for college tuition, and a way out of a dead end job. For ten thousand dollars, he agreed to help crew a boat loaded wit drugs from the Virgin Islands to New York City, setting sail on an ill-fated expedition that eventually landed him in federal prison.</i>

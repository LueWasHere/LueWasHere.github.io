                    Upon his release from prison, Ganto's commitment to becoming a writer is evident through his actions. He seeks guidance from established writers and attends workshops to refine his craft. Reflecting on his determination, Ganto shares, "I wrote with a ferocity born of self-discovery and youthful energy". This statement highlights Ganto's unwavering resolve to pursue his passion for writing. His dedication, combined with his newfound self-awareness and understanding of the power of words, propels him forward on his journey to becoming a writer. As he reflects on his progress, he observes, "I realized that writing was more than a career or even a passion. It was a way of life, a way of making sense of the world around me". This realization demonstrates the extent to which writing has become an integral part of Ganto's identity and his newfound appreciation for the role of writing in his personal growth and redemption.

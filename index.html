                    <p>ASCII has existed for a long time, it's existed even all the way back in 1867 when we were using typwritters to create illistrations. This lives on, even now, with people like <a href="https://jamescookartwork.com/">James Cook</a> who creates breath taking images with typewriters. These illistrations, though, are not <i>true</i> ASCII art, as ASCII art is created on a digital medium with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII system</a>, and for that, we need to go to the year 1966 with Kenneth Knowlton. Most of the early examples we have of ASCII art we have originates from him. ASCII art was created in most part because of the technical limitations of printers at the time, this meaned, when poeple wanted to have art, they had to get a little creative.</p>

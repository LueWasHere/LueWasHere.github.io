                <h3>Making ASCII art.</h3>
                <p>
                    Choose an image: The first step in creating ASCII art is to choose an image that you want to recreate. This could be anything from a photograph to a simple icon or logo.<br>

                    Convert the image to grayscale: To create ASCII art, you'll need to work with a grayscale version of your image. You can use any photo editing software to convert your image to grayscale.<br>
                    
                    Adjust the brightness and contrast: Once you've converted your image to grayscale, you may need to adjust the brightness and contrast to make sure that the details in the image are clear and visible.<br>
                    
                    Choose your character set: ASCII art is created using a set of characters from the ASCII character set. You can use any characters you like, but some popular options include the "@" symbol, "#" symbol, and various letters and numbers.<br>
                    
                    Choose your software: To create your ASCII art, you can use any text editor or ASCII art software. Some popular options include Notepad, Sublime Text, and ASCII Generator.<br>
                    
                    Start creating your ASCII art: Begin by copying the grayscale image into your text editor or ASCII art software. Then, start replacing each pixel in the image with a corresponding character from your chosen character set. For example, you might use the "@" symbol to represent a dark pixel and a "." symbol to represent a light pixel.<br>
                    
                    Add shading and detail: To create more sophisticated ASCII art, you can use different characters to create shading and detail in your image. For example, you might use the "/" and "" symbols to create diagonal lines, or use the "()" symbols to create circles.<br>
                    
                    Final touches: Once you've finished your ASCII art, you can make any final adjustments or edits to make sure that the image looks the way you want it to. You can also experiment with different character sets or software to see which ones work best for your needs.<br>
                    
                    And that's it! With a little bit of practice and experimentation, you can create stunning ASCII art that is both unique and visually striking.<br>
